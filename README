1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
It seems that we hear the phrase 'cloud computing' every day, be it on Slashdot
or in some marketing literature somewhere, yet few people can really give
you a straight answer as to what a cloud is or how the concept can be used 
to make your life easier.  Fogmachine aims to give some definition to these
questions, to supply you with a means to create your own cloud, and to give
you tools to manipulate the virtual machines running inside your cloud.

Fogmachine is based upon Facebook's shiny new Tornado framework and works in
tandem with Cobbler, Michael DeHaan's awesome provisioning tool.  Cobbler is
used to provision virtual guests, while libvirt is used to query virtual guests
and hosts for pertinent information.

Finally, a disclaimer...  Fogmachine is a massive hack, inside a bug, 
wrapped in a kludge.  I wouldn't recommend running it in production unless you 
possess an ace team of crackerjack security and performance experts to aid you
in its deployment, as little mind has been paid towards these particular
aspects of its functionality.

2. PREREQUISITES
----------------
First off, ensure that you have the following packages installed on your
machine:

libvirt
libvirt-python
python
python-devel
python-pycurl
python-simplejson

Next, as it isn't yet packaged for any Linux distribution, download and install
the latest version of Tornado from its website:

Aaaaand...  you're done.
